# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
This project showcases a Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard designed to help business managers and analysts make data-driven decisions. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of sales, profit, quantity, and delivery performance across multiple categories, sub-categories, and regions.

The client wanted a centralized, interactive dashboard to track sales trends, identify profitable regions, and forecast future demand. Their raw dataset was unstructured and difficult to interpret, so I used Power Query to clean and transform the data, created DAX measures to calculate KPIs such as total sales, profit, and average delivery days, and built interactive visuals to highlight key business insights.

**Key visuals include:**

-Sales and profit by category and sub-category (Technology, Office Supplies, Furniture)

-Regional sales breakdown (West, East, South, Central)

-Payment mode and customer segment analysis

-Year-over-Year (YoY) comparison of sales and profits (2019–2020)

-15–20-day sales forecast using Power BI’s forecasting visuals

**From the analysis:**

-The West region generated the highest sales (33%)

-Consumer segment contributed 48% of total revenue

-COD payments accounted for 43% of all transactions

-Streamline inventory forecasting for top categories using predictive analytic

This dashboard allowed the client to monitor business performance in real time, identify growth opportunities, and make confident, data-backed decisions. The forecasting feature helped improve inventory planning and sales strategy, leading to more efficient resource allocation.

**🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used:**
-Power BI Desktop

-Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)

-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

-Excel (initial data setup)

-Forecasting visuals & KPI cards

**Impact:**
This project demonstrates how data visualization can turn raw business data into meaningful insights. The client now has a single, automated dashboard that reduces reporting time, improves visibility, and supports smarter decision-making across teams.
